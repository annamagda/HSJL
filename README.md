# Health and Spatial Justice Lab

## Overview
The  Health and Spatial Justice Lab is not a physical space but rather an umbrella for research, community engagement, and public scholarship that addresses spatial inequities in health, including but not limited to health outcomes, access to health care, and social determinants of health. The Lab builds on the Health Studies Programâ€™s existing curricular strengths in health equity, environmental health, structural racism and health, the built environment, and community health, and establishes new mechanisms for research partnerships, methods training, and mentoring. The Lab will support faculty and students to do place-based work that draws on conceptual frameworks introduced in Health Studies courses and offers methods training to study relationships between social determinants and health outcomes. The Lab centers geospatial mapping and spatial statistics, while supporting mixed methods approaches that pair quantitative and spatial analysis with qualitative, ethnographic, and archival work.
